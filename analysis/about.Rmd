My name is Bryant Molloy, and I am a Data Analyst at the IRONMAN Group. I graduated from the University of Connecticut with a B.S.E. degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2017 and went on to earn a Master of Science in Business Analytics degree from the University of Miami in 2018. During this time, I had multiple analytics internships in sports, at both the team level with the Miami Marlins and at the company level with Zensah.

I started this analytics blog to create a portfolio of projects that combine my career interests and aspirations in data science with my love of sports, especially basketball. My goal is to create a group of posts that cover a wide variety of sports topics and that allow me to hone and develop my data science skillset. 

I am always looking for ideas for my next post topic, so please feel free to contact me with any feedback, questions, or suggestions at my email below!
